# Admin backend

The main job of the admin-backend is file handling. Upload and deletion of files should be triggered here.

The following endpoints are provided by the _admin-backend_:

-   `/delete_document/{id}`: Deletes the file from storage and vector database. The `id` can be retrieved from the `/all_documents` endpoint.
-   `/document_reference/{id}`: Returns the document.
-   `/all_documents`: Return the id of all available documents currently stored. Files will be available in this list immediately after the upload, however they might still be processed and are not yet available in the chat.
-   `/upload_documents`: Endpoint to upload PDF files.

# Requirements

All required python libraries can be found in the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) file.
The admin-backend uses the base Dockerfile of the [rag-core-library](../rag-core-library/) and share the system requirements with this library.

# Endpoints

## `/delete_document/{id}`

Will delete the document from the connected storage system and will send a request to the `backend` to delete all related Documents from the vector database.

## `/document_reference/{id}`

Will return the source document stored in the connected storage system.

## `/all_documents`

Will return a list of all available documents in the connected storage.

> **Note**:
> Might list Documents which are still being processed and are not available yet for chatting.

## `/upload_documents`

PDF files can be uploaded here. This endpoint will process the document in a background and will extract information using the [document-extractor](../document-extractor/).
The extracted information will be summarized using LLM. The summary, as well as the unrefined extracted document, will be uploaded to the [rag-backend](../rag-backend/).

# Deployment

A detailed explanation of the deployment can be found in the [Readme](../README.md) of the project.
The _helm-chart_ used for the deployment can be found [here](../helm-chart/charts/adminfrontend/).
