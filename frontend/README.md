## Folder Structure
[Simple Nx Monorepo Concept](https://nx.dev/concepts/more-concepts/monorepo-nx-enterprise#scope-where-a-library-lives-who-owns-it)


- `apps/`: Base of the apps chat & administration
- `libs/`: main logic at feature-* folders, shared dumb ui components and utils. See [Library Types in Nx](https://nx.dev/concepts/more-concepts/library-types)
- `i18n`: For localization, each app has its own folder: `i18n/chat` and `i18n/admin`

## Theming

To change the theme, open the `tailwind.config.js` file and refer to the available color configuration options for DaisyUI at https://daisyui.com/docs/colors/

## Environment variables
- VITE_API_URL = The URL for the backend
- VITE_ADMIN_URL = The URL where the admin frontend is running
- VITE_CHAT_URL = The URL where the chat frontend is running

> Important: 
>
> The environment variables are not used after the docker-image is build. 
> When using the `Dockerfile` to run the frontend you have to copy the build frontend  from `/app/frontend` to `/usr/share/nginx/html` and run the `/app/env.sh` script. 
>This can be done with the following command:
> ```bash
>cp -r /app/frontend/. /usr/share/nginx/html
>/bin/sh -c /app/env.sh
>```
>This is a workaround for the inability of *VITE* to use env-vars at runtime.
