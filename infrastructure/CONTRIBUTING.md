## :wrench: How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository** :fork_and_knife:: Start by forking our repository to create your own version, which allows you to work freely on your changes.
2. **Create a Branch** :herb:: For any feature or fix, create a new branch with a meaningful name (e.g., `feature/new-ui` or `fix/typo-docs`) so that it’s easy to keep track of.
3. **Make Your Changes** :hammer:: Implement your changes, whether they’re code updates, documentation edits, or other improvements. If your change requires documentation, please update the corresponding README or other relevant files.
4. **Test Thoroughly** :white_check_mark:: If you’re modifying code, please test your changes to make sure everything works smoothly.

- **Be Clear** :memo:: Please ensure that your code is well-documented, and your PR description explains the purpose of your changes.
- **Follow Code Standards** :broom:: We aim to keep our codebase clean and consistent, so please follow established coding conventions.
