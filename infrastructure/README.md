## 1. Components and Configuration Values to Adjust

This Repository contains the helm chart for the following RAG components:

- [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) (dependency)
- [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) (dependency)
- [KeyDB](https://docs.keydb.dev/) (dependency)
- Frontend
- Backend

> üìù NOTE: Only the settings you are most likely to adjust are listed here. For all available settings please have a look at the [values.yaml](rag/values.yaml).

Except all `backend` services all components can be disabled and exchanged with components of your choice.
This can be done by overwriting the following values in your `values.yaml`

```yaml
features:
  langfuse:
    enabled: true
  qdrant:
    enabled: true
  frontend:
    enabled: true
  minio:
    enabled: true
  keydb:
    enabled: true
```

It is optional to provide an `imagePullSecret`. If you need one for pulling the images belonging to the rag-template you can either provide your own already existing secret by using the example below:

```yaml
shared:
  imagePullSecret:
    create: false
    name: cr-credentials
```

Or you can create a secret with your own values like this:

```yaml
shared:
  imagePullSecret:
    create: true
    name: cr-credentials
    auths:
      username: ...
      pat: ...
      email: ...
```

For local development, the `imagePullSecret` is not necessary.

### 1.1 Langfuse

You can deploy Langfuse with initial values for the public and secret API keys. The respective values are shown below:

```yaml
langfuse:
  langfuse:
    additionalEnv:
      LANGFUSE_INIT_ORG_ID:
      LANGFUSE_INIT_PROJECT_ID:
      LANGFUSE_INIT_PROJECT_PUBLIC_KEY:
      LANGFUSE_INIT_PROJECT_SECRET_KEY:
      LANGFUSE_INIT_USER_EMAIL:
      LANGFUSE_INIT_USER_NAME:
      LANGFUSE_INIT_USER_PASSWORD:
```

Besides, you can deploy Langfuse in a two-step approach. First, you deploy Langfuse without the API keys, and then you can create the API keys via the Web UI. Therefore, after deployment, you have to sign up in the Web UI and create a project in the local Langfuse instance, create API keys via the settings; see below.

![langfuse-api-key](./figures/langfuse-api-access.png)

Default values for the deployment are provided in the `rag/values.yaml` file under the `langfuse` key.

> üìù NOTE: Langfuse utilizes a PostgreSQL database under the hood.
>In production, it is recommended to use the [STACKIT Postgresflex](https://www.stackit.de/en/product/stackit-postgresql-flex/) instead of the Postgres deployment bundled with Langfuse.
>You have to change the following values to use [STACKIT Postgresflex](https://www.stackit.de/en/product/stackit-postgresql-flex/):
>
>```yaml
>langfuse:
>  deploy: false
>  host: ...
>  auth:
>    username: ...
>    password: ...
>    database: ...
>```
>
>All values containing `...` are placeholders and have to be replaced with real values.

### 1.2 Qdrant

The deployment of the Qdrant can be disabled by setting the following value in the helm-chart:

```yaml
features:
  qdrant:
    enabled: false
```

For more information on the values for the Qdrant helm chart please consult the [README of the Qdrant helm chart](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-helm/blob/qdrant-1.12.3/charts/qdrant/README.md).

> ‚ìò INFO: Qdrant is a subchart of this helm chart with the name `qdrant`. Therefore, all configuration values for Qdrant are required to be under the key `qdrant`, e.g. for changing the `replicaCount` you have to add the following value:

```yaml
qdrant:
  replicaCount: 3
```

### 1.3 KeyDB

The usage of the KeyDB is **only recommended for development** purposes. KeyDB is used as alternative to Redis to store the state of each uploaded document. The Admin Backend uses the key-value-pairs of the KeyDB to keep track of the current state of the RAG sources. Note, sources include documents as well as non-document sources like confluence.

In **production**, the usage of a fully-managed Redis instance (e.g. provided by STACKIT) is recommended. The following parameters need to be adjusted in the `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
adminBackend:
  keyValueStore:
    USECASE_KEYVALUE_HOST: ...
features:
  keydb:
    enabled: false
```

### 1.4 Frontend

The following values should be adjusted for the deployment:

```yaml
frontend:
  envs:
    vite:
      VITE_API_URL: ... # You should add the public url to the backend here
      VITE_CHAT_URL: ... # You should add the public url to the chat frontend here

  ingress:
    host:
      name: ... # You should add the DNS for the chat-frontend here

  secrets:
    viteAuth:
      VITE_AUTH_USERNAME: ... # You should add the username for the basic auth of the backend here
      VITE_AUTH_PASSWORD: ... # You should add the password for the basic auth of the backend here

```

### 1.5 Backend

The following values should be adjusted for the deployment:

```yaml
backend:
  secrets:

    basicAuth: ...
    langfuse:
      publicKey: ...
      secretKey: ...
    openai:
      apiKey: ...
    # LLM secrets. Only the secrets for the LLM you choose have to be provided
    # With the exception of the class `stackit` the embedder and llm share the secrets
    #
    # stackit
    stackitEmbedder:
      apiKey: ...
    stackitVllm:
      apiKey: ...
    # for ollama there is no apikey setting

  envs:
    # Decide which LLM you would like to use for answering/embedding.
    # These settings are independent of each other. You can use a different LLM for embedding and answering.
    ragClassTypes:
      RAG_CLASS_TYPE_LLM_TYPE: "stackit"
    embedderClassTypes:
      EMBEDDER_CLASS_TYPE_EMBEDDER_TYPE: "stackit"
    # Settings for the retriever. These should be adjusted for your use-case.
    # Finding the correct setting to not retrieve too many or not enough documents from the vector database is
    # important for a good result.
    retriever:
      RETRIEVER_THRESHOLD: 0.3
      RETRIEVER_K_DOCUMENTS: 10
      RETRIEVER_TOTAL_K: 7

```

> üìù NOTE: All values containg `...` are placeholders and have to be replaced with real values.

> ‚ìò INFO: This deployment comes with multiple options. You can change the `global.config.envs.rag_class_types.RAG_CLASS_TYPE_LLM_TYPE` in `./rag/values.yaml` to one of the following values:
>
> - `stackit`: Uses the STACKIT LLM as an LLM provider.
> - `ollama`: Uses Ollama as an LLM provider.
>
> The same options are also available for the `backend.envs.ragClassTypes.RAG_CLASS_TYPE_EMBEDDER_TYPE`.

### 1.6 Use Case Environment Variables

To add use case specific environment variables, the `usecase` secret and configmap can be used. Adding new environment variables to the `usecase` secret and configmap can be done by adding the following values to the `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
shared:
  envs:
    usecase:
      USECASE_CONFIG_MAP_ENV_VAR: ...
  secrets:
    usecase:
      USECASE_SECRET_ENV_VAR: ...
```

## 2. Requirements and Setup Instructions

The following section describes the requirements for the infrastructure setup and provides instructions for the local and production setup.

> üìù NOTE: *Windows users*: make sure you use WSL for infrastructure setup & orchestration.

### 2.1 Local setup instructions

The following is a list of the dependencies. If you miss one of the dependencies, click on the name and follow the installation instructions.

- [*k3d*](https://k3d.io/v5.6.0/#installation)
- [*helm*](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

For local deployment it is recommended to use [*tilt*](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html).

In the following, the *k3d* cluster setup and the setup inside the *k3d* will be explained.

#### 2.1.1 k3d Cluster Setup

Assumption: You are in the root directory of this repository. A local registry is created at `registry.localhost:5000`.

```shell
cd local-cluster-setup && bash setup-k3d-cluster.sh
```

Note: only tested under Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)

In case of an error, you have to manually set up the *k3d* cluster and the nginx ingress controller (if necessary).

##### (Optional) Setup-check

Images can be pushed, pulled, removed etc. to/from the local repo, see:

```shell
docker pull busybox:latest
docker tag busybox:latest registry.localhost:5000/busybox:latest
docker push registry.localhost:5000/busybox:latest
docker run --rm registry.localhost:5000/busybox:latest /bin/sh -c "echo '<<< stackiteers say \"hello\" to you ]:-> >>>'"
docker image rm registry.localhost:5000/busybox:latest
```

It is time to check if the cluster works with the local repo :sunglasses: :

```shell
kubectl run test-pod-name --image registry.localhost:5000/busybox:latest -- /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo '<<< stackiteers say \"hello\" to you ]:-> >>>'; sleep 1; done"
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod test-pod-name
kubectl logs test-pod-name
kubectl delete po test-pod-name
```

Under linux, `*.localhost` should be resolved :fire:, otherwise you have to adjust the hosts file. In windows and macOS append the hosts file with the following line:

```shell
127.0.0.1 registry.localhost
```

More information about adjusting the hosts file can be found in the section 'Access via ingress'.

#### 2.1.2 Tilt Deployment

The following will spin up the microservices in *k3d*

```shell
tilt up
```

Environment variables are loaded from the `.env` file in the same directory the `Tiltfile` is located. The [use case README](../README.md#installation--usage) should contain a list of the required variables.

The Tilt UI is available at [http://localhost:10350/](http://localhost:10350/)

If you want to access MinIO/Qdrant etc. just click the resource in the UI. In the upper corner will be the link, to access the resource.

To enable debugging, follow instructions in [README](../README.md).

The following will delete everything deployed with `tilt up` command

```shell
tilt down
```

#### 2.1.3 Access via Ingress

To access the ingress by its hostname, the hosts file need to be adjusted. On *linux/macOS*, you have to adjust `/etc/hosts` as follows.

```shell
echo "127.0.0.1 rag.localhost" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts > /dev/null
```

Afterwards, the services are accessible from [http://rag.localhost](http://rag.localhost)

Note: The command above has only been tested on *Ubuntu 22.04 LTS*.

On *Windows* you can adjust the hosts file as described [here](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/paperspace/machines/how-to/edit-windows-hosts-file/).

### 2.2 Production Setup Instructions

The *helm* chart provided in this repository requires a *NGINX Ingress Controller*, (e.g. [Bitnami package for NGINX Ingress Controller](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/nginx-ingress-controller)).
If you want to use SSL-Encryption, a Cert-Manager is also required. An installation tutorial for the *STACKIT Cert-Manager Webhook* can be found in the [Github Repository](https://github.com/stackitcloud/stackit-cert-manager-webhook).
For deployment of the *NGINX Ingress Controller* and a cert-manager, the following helm chart can be used:

[base-setup](server-setup/base-setup/Chart.yaml)

The email [here](server-setup/base-setup/templates/cert-issuer.yaml) should be changed from `<replace@me.com>` to a real email address.
