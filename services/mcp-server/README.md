# MCP Server

The MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides a bridge between MCP-compatible clients and the RAG backend. It enables AI assistants and other tools to interact with the RAG system through standardized MCP tools.

## Features ðŸš€

- **Simple Chat Interface**: Basic question-answering without conversation history
- **Chat with History**: Conversational interface that maintains context across messages
- **Citation Support**: Returns source documents and metadata for transparency
- **Streamable HTTP Transport**: Uses HTTP-based transport for reliable communication
- **Configurable Settings**: Environment-based configuration for different deployment scenarios

## Architecture

The server consists of several key components:

- **RagMcpServer**: Main server class that handles MCP tool registration and request routing
- **Dependency Container**: Manages dependency injection for clean architecture
- **Settings**: Environment-based configuration management
- **RAG Backend Client**: Auto-generated OpenAPI client for backend communication

## Requirements

All required python libraries can be found in the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) file.
The MCP server uses Poetry for dependency management and shares the base Dockerfile pattern with other services in the RAG template.

## Available Tools

The server exposes two main MCP tools for interacting with the RAG system:

### `chat_simple`

Simple question-answering interface that returns plain text responses.

**Parameters:**

- `session_id` (str): Unique identifier for the chat session
- `message` (str): The question or message to send to the RAG system

**Returns:**

- `str`: Plain text answer from the RAG system

### `chat_with_history`

Advanced chat interface that supports conversation history and returns structured responses with citations.

**Parameters:**

- `session_id` (str): Unique identifier for the chat session
- `message` (str): The current question or message
- `history` (list[dict], optional): Previous conversation history

**History Format:**
Each history item should be a dictionary with:

- `role`: Either "user" or "assistant"
- `message`: The message content

**Returns:**

- `dict`: Structured response containing:
  - `answer`: The response text
  - `finish_reason`: Why the response ended
  - `citations`: List of source documents with content and metadata

## Configuration

The server supports configuration through environment variables with the following prefixes:

### MCP Settings (`MCP_` prefix)

- `MCP_HOST`: Server bind address (default: `0.0.0.0`)
- `MCP_PORT`: Server port (default: `8000`)
- `MCP_NAME`: Server name (default: `RAG MCP server`)

### Backend Settings (`BACKEND_` prefix)

- `BACKEND_BASE_PATH`: RAG backend URL (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`)

### Tool Documentation Configuration

The MCP server supports customizable documentation for its tools through environment variables. This allows you to customize the descriptions, parameter explanations, and examples shown to MCP clients.

#### Chat Simple Tool Documentation

- `MCP_CHAT_SIMPLE_DESCRIPTION`: Main description of the tool
- `MCP_CHAT_SIMPLE_PARAMETER_DESCRIPTIONS`: JSON object mapping parameter names to descriptions
- `MCP_CHAT_SIMPLE_RETURNS`: Description of the return value
- `MCP_CHAT_SIMPLE_NOTES`: Additional notes about the tool
- `MCP_CHAT_SIMPLE_EXAMPLES`: Usage examples

#### Chat With History Tool Documentation

- `MCP_CHAT_WITH_HISTORY_DESCRIPTION`: Main description of the tool
- `MCP_CHAT_WITH_HISTORY_PARAMETER_DESCRIPTIONS`: JSON object mapping parameter names to descriptions
- `MCP_CHAT_WITH_HISTORY_RETURNS`: Description of the return value
- `MCP_CHAT_WITH_HISTORY_NOTES`: Additional notes about the tool
- `MCP_CHAT_WITH_HISTORY_EXAMPLES`: Usage examples

#### Example Configuration

```env
# Custom tool descriptions
MCP_CHAT_SIMPLE_DESCRIPTION="Ask questions about your documents and get instant answers."
MCP_CHAT_SIMPLE_EXAMPLES="chat_simple(session_id='my-session', message='What is the main topic of the document?')"

# Custom parameter descriptions (JSON format)
MCP_CHAT_SIMPLE_PARAMETER_DESCRIPTIONS='{"session_id": "A unique session identifier for your conversation", "message": "Your question about the documents"}'

# Custom return description
MCP_CHAT_SIMPLE_RETURNS="A plain text answer based on your document content"

# Notes about usage
MCP_CHAT_SIMPLE_NOTES="This tool is best for simple questions that don't require conversation context."
```

#### Template Rendering

The MCP server uses Jinja2 templates to generate tool documentation in **numpy docstring format**. When the environment variables are set, they are rendered into a structured docstring that MCP clients can parse and display.

**Example of rendered docstring:**

Given the configuration above, the `chat_simple` tool's docstring would be rendered as:

```python
def chat_simple(session_id: str, message: str) -> str:
    """Ask questions about your documents and get instant answers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    session_id : str
        A unique session identifier for your conversation
    message : str
        Your question about the documents

    Returns
    -------
    str
        A plain text answer based on your document content

    Notes
    -----
    This tool is best for simple questions that don't require conversation context.

    Examples
    --------
    chat_simple(session_id='my-session', message='What is the main topic of the document?')
    """
```

This numpy-style docstring format ensures compatibility with documentation tools and provides clear, structured information to MCP clients about how to use each tool.

### Helm Chart Configuration

For production deployments, the MCP server documentation can be configured through the Helm chart's `values.yaml` file. This provides a structured way to manage tool documentation across different environments.

The MCP configuration is located under `backend.mcp` in the [values.yaml](../../infrastructure/rag/values.yaml) file:

```yaml
backend:
  mcp:
    # Basic MCP server settings
    name: "mcp"
    port: "8000"
    host: "0.0.0.0"

    # Chat simple tool configuration
    chatSimpleDescription: "Send a message to the RAG system and get a simple text response.\n\nThis is the simplest way to interact with the RAG system - just provide a message and get back the answer as plain text."
    chatSimpleParameterDescriptions:
      session_id: "Unique identifier for the chat session."
      message: "The message/question to ask the RAG system."
    chatSimpleReturns: "The answer from the RAG system as plain text."
    chatSimpleNotes: ""
    chatSimpleExamples: ""

    # Chat with history tool configuration
    chatWithHistoryDescription: "Send a message with conversation history and get structured response.\n\nProvide conversation history as a simple list of dictionaries.\nEach history item should have 'role' (either 'user' or 'assistant') and 'message' keys."
    chatWithHistoryParameterDescriptions:
      session_id: "Unique identifier for the chat session."
      message: "The current message/question to ask."
      history: "Previous conversation history. Each item should be:\n    {\"role\": \"user\" or \"assistant\", \"message\": \"the message text\"}"
    chatWithHistoryReturns: "Response containing:\n    - answer: The response text\n    - finish_reason: Why the response ended\n    - citations: List of source documents used (simplified)"
    chatWithHistoryNotes: ""
    chatWithHistoryExamples: ""
```

These values are automatically converted to the appropriate environment variables (with `MCP_` prefix) when the Helm chart is deployed. The `chatSimpleParameterDescriptions` and `chatWithHistoryParameterDescriptions` dictionaries are automatically converted to JSON format for consumption by the MCP server.

This approach allows you to:

- Manage documentation consistently across environments
- Version control your tool documentation
- Use different documentation for different deployments (dev, staging, production)
- Leverage Helm's templating features for dynamic documentation

## Deployment

The MCP server is designed to be deployed alongside the main RAG backend as a sidecar container. A detailed explanation of the deployment can be found in the [main README](../README.md) and the [infrastructure README](../rag-infrastructure/README.md) of the project.

### Docker Support

The server includes Docker support for containerized deployment and is integrated into the main Tilt development workflow.

### Integration in RAG Template

The MCP server is automatically deployed when `backend.mcp.enabled=true` is set in the Helm values. It runs as a sidecar container alongside the main RAG backend, accessible via:

- **Port**: 8000 (configurable via `MCP_PORT`)
- **Endpoint**: `/mcp` path through the main ingress
- **Development**: Port-forwarded to 9090 in local Tilt setup

## Development

The MCP server is integrated into the main RAG template development workflow:

- **Tilt Integration**: Automatically built and deployed with live reload
- **Linting**: Included in the main linting pipeline
- **Testing**: Part of the overall test suite
- **Debugging**: Supports the same debugging workflow as other services

For detailed development setup instructions, see the [main README](../README.md).
